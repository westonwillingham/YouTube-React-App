# YouTube-React-App
Simple app that I made while I learned React.  It taught me about storing state variables, functional components vs class components, and overall React structure.  I don't come from a front end background, but I am learning React so that I can build web3 applications. 

To run this application, run "npm install" and then "npm start" in your terminal. 

This application lets you search for videos on YouTube and watch them, displaying five videos to pick from on the right hand side.
